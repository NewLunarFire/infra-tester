So, the other day I was debugging weird TLS certificates problem with our infrastructure.

I finally find the problem and I learned that Java has stricter TLS requirements.

So here is a tool to use for quickly testing a http(s) connection to a specified host.

I only did the minimal features and I will wait to have real life needs before implementing it.

Enjoy!
